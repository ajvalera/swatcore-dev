Although it was somewhat big --- about 40 students --- there was still some really good discussions we had. It is mostly lecture based, though, and almost 3 hours long on a Monday. If you have any interest in Shakespeare, this class is well worth your time.",

        "comment": "Don is very good at delivering lecture material and explaining things clear. His office hours are also very accessible as long as they are not occupied by other higher level math course students. Although Discrete Math is listed as a writing course, it really doesn't have a lot of writing. All the writing we did was in weekly problem sets where we explain how we prove things in a paragraph or two at most. The only actual writing that I consider as writing is this final paper we have where we have to solve and explain a problem by proof of induction, and it has to be 3-5 pages. Discrete math itself is also really fun and I find it quite helpful for upper level CS courses. I would recommend CS majors to take this as soon as possible. The only downside is that if you are not super into math this course can be a tad too mathy sometimes.",

He's quite good in office hours though.\n\nLabs (called \"projects\") in comparison to other advanced-level Swat CS courses, were a bit easier than average in the sense that they involved less original implementation of code. The difficult aspects were usually trying to make sense of the complicated starter code Andy provided us with, but once you get past that point it's all interesting applications of a basic concept.\n\nCulminating project involved choosing a specific area of graphics not covered in class, extending a topic that was covered in class, or building something of your own using learned concepts. Definitely interesting, though make sure to start early so that you can ask him a lot of questions since it's such an open-ended project.\n\nIn the end, it's not entirely the most useful class in the world; I signed up for it out of an innate interest in how rendering 3-dimensional scenes works, and came away mildly satisfied.",

Schneider is a good lecturer and, again, the material is very interesting.  I acknowledge that he can be pretty repetitious, but it really helps you to remember key material and sets you up well for the exams (there's only the midterm and the final).  The test are multiple choice and aren't difficult if you go over the lecture material ahead of time.  You have the option of writing a 2-3 page paper if you want to boost your grade.  Schneider is a really great professor and, if you express a little interest, will likely offer you the opportunity to work in his lab.  If you like neurobiology and are taking some other tough classes, this class is an awesome choice. ",

One thing that irked me about the class is how she would almost always use variables instead of actual values for example problems, along with the occasional mistake she might make in class that would force her to start over.  She would also sometimes not do the math for examples and move on, which could be a bit annoying for someone like me who prefers seeing a problem worked out entirely in order to better understand it. One thing for class and lab to make note of is that Piovoso and Moulter use different symbols for variables, which can be very confusing. Other than that... it's hard to tell how you're doing in the class because tests get returned very late (Our class got our first quiz back the night before the last test before the final...) but it's interesting stuff.",

        "comment": "First, I took Economics to get my social science requirement out of the way, so I'm not that excited about economics to begin with. The class was very boring for almost the entire semester. Professor Bayer is extremely intelligent, nice, and passionate about economics, but she moves through material at a very slow pace. It's frustrating to be asked questions like \"Give an example of an opportunity cost you had over the weekend\" at 8:30 in the morning and then wait 10 minutes as classmates say the same thing over and over again. The class is not particularly difficult, but the workload is somewhat annoying. We had problem sets each week and mandatory meetings with assigned groups to talk about the homework together. The midterm was a little bit tricky, but if one actually kept up with the reading and did the practice exam, getting an A should be relatively easy. We also had to do a paper assignment--- it sounded a lot worse than it is. It's only 3-5 pages and you can have diagrams. Still, it's kind of a pointless assignment.\n\nFor someone who was a little bit interested in Econ, the class went too slow in the beginning. I think the class would have been a lot more interesting had the professor went for a more direct lecture style instead of interspersing rather lame class interactive questions/activities.",

Kevin basically let us do whatever we had in mind. It didn't necessarily have to have anything to do with cloud computing. Some people in the class decided to develop websites / apps that used EC2 as a hosting service and he was fine with it. Overall pretty good class.

He explained his concepts clearly and used funny examples along the way -- you'll hear about ponies, and unicorns a lot. :) CS 21 was not too hard and it gave you a basic understanding of computer science / programming. You get to learn one of the best programming language, Python. After taking this course, I would say you can understand online tutorials of other programming languages. It opened up another way of thinking that is valuable in this era.

But the course gives you flexibility to delve into your field of interest. There is a final paper and you can pick whatever topic that interests you. The course material largely revolved around climate models and predictions / reading graphs. I remember the field trip was fun. We went to this wetland park or something next to the airport and it felt like a chill hiking trip. I'll definitely recommend the class. I think it was fun and not a lot of work.

I was going to this conference and coming back on Sunday. She asked me to hand in my problem set Sunday afternoon when there was a mid-term on Monday. No extension given. In class, she basically walked us through the book. Listening her confused me. Though I heard some good things about her office hours. Still, think twice before you take this class with her!",

He gave great lectures and it really got me interested in classical music. This class, I would say, was one of the most valuable classes I've taken here at Swarthmore. Now the down side. This class was quite a lot of work. We have weekly music quizzes (pretty hard too). He played us a part of the music, we had to identify the piece, the part it's from and the elements inside. Pretty crazy. And he was sooooo... hard on writing. He's really picky and I literally got comments from a through y. I wouldn't say he's super nice, but this course is still worth-taking! :)",

        "comment": "Professor Ghannam is so nice that she is like my mother—she will feed you on your lonely Thanksgiving night, if you end up stuck here because your parents for whatever reason do not want to see your face. I imagine that the experience of the class will be different depending on where you are in your life, but a few things are to be expected if you decide to take this class. Like the class size,  for example, which is always about thirty. Although some might say it is too big, Professor Ghannam is armed with the magic of weaving together what everyone has to say in an almost seamless way, and you will feel happy about yourself because she will fool you into thinking that your bullshit makes sense. Do not despair if you are not very fond of bullshitting, for I myself have learned a lot from this class, regardless. The first half will dedicated to theoretical texts on the body that are important to anthropologists. You will get to read that famous Foucault book, which I now feel the urge to tear apart though in an endearing way, if you know what I mean. Whether or not the second half—dedicated to presentations by your peers, mostly—is fun really depends on your taste. You can always make it fun by giving a presentation on zombies.\n\nI took the class as a first-year, so I was lucky because it was the upperclassmen who had to put up with me who was still learning how to swim in this harsh world of Swarthmore academics. I have given advice to some of my anthropology senior friends not to take it, because they might not like the class filled with novices like me. I am being so exclusive! And perhaps mean, too! But such is life! Maybe? Take this class, regardless!",

It is about the Global Enlightenment, true, but the syllabus is a jumble of seemingly random things. But randomness can fascinate, and if you trust Professor Azfar, who is really smart and talks a lot in class, you might enjoy the ride with him. He will make sure you notice his fascination with the sea, and in a way taking this class is like setting sail with him to somewhere beyond the horizon. At some point you might find yourself questioning what in the world you are doing—but there, you just evoke the concept of the world, something not to be taken for granted! Professor Azfar is really intent on making history exciting, and that I really appreciate. Secretly, there is the Benjaminian spirit that drives the class—and if you don't know who Benjamin is, consider yourself lucky. You will be writing blog posts, which can be fun, and you will get fascinated every time Azfar finds ways to make your blog posts sound intelligent, although you might write them at four in the morning. There are two papers, and he encourages us to do micro-histories by way of following certain things to see where they bring us.",

Kevin was really clear in his instructions. And he's super nice! I love how he recorded every lecture, so in case you don't completely understand the class you can always go back to it later. He had great powerpoints that were available online. Great resources provided. The down side was we had this 3-question quiz at the beginning of each class, it was kind of scary. Though it accounted for 5% of your grade (and another 5% for participation, so doing the clicker thing), you still have to nail it to get an A. But since this is a major-required class (so you have to take it anyways if you're a major), I would highly recommend taking it with Kevin! ",

You gain a lot of important skills in this class and learn a lot of fundamentals that are key to further programming work in any discipline. One criticism I have is the way quizzes are given. I don't think the study guides are generally good enough preparation for the problems you have to do on the quizzes, especially since there are no problem sets. It would be helpful to have more similar problems one could do to prepare as opposed to the few given on the study guide. Other than that, great course.",

It pretty much picks up where Bio 001 leaves off (which might make it a good first intermediate-level course) and it has a similar structure, but with more intense/interesting labs, some paper discussions, and student presentations at the end of the semester. \n\nVallen is really scrupulous about teaching well, which you can't say about every professor. For example, the first six labs fit together into one big project, and at the end of it you sit down with her and talk about what you've learned for 20 minutes instead of having a traditional written exam, because she really wants to give you a chance to show her what you've learned. If that sounds scary, don't worry; she doesn't bite. She expects some effort from you, but as long as you're trying, she wants you to do well.\n\nBasically Bio 001 2.0, taught well. It's a good choice if you want to learn more about little bio, and especially if you had Vallen in Bio 001 and liked her.",

The readings were relatively light for each class, with a heavy focus on primary sources. The lecture format made any attempt at discussion a bit stilted, but overall the class was informative and interesting. ",

If I concentrate on listening to what he says and tries to understand the concepts, I'll miss out on copying down notes. The exams were of appropriate difficulty, though unexpectedly he's a hard grader. Overall I would say only take the class if you're into machine learning / NLP. ",

It really got me to think about the whole philosophy behind the study of history in ways like I'd never before. Then the last two-thirds of the class we just spent reading counterfactuals and alternate histories. It was really awesome to be reading this somewhat fantastical works in a history class and discussing them in depth. Lastly, the professor Burke is an awesome guy and really brilliant, the way he thought about and taught history was very engaging.

Jo Sensei is an adequate professor. She \\ does not break down the fundamentals of japanese in a way that is very approachable for native english speakers, perhaps due to the fact that she is a native japanese speaker. Schad Sensei on the other hand is the greatest language professor I've ever had. He really knows japanese and english at high levels and as such explains the japanese language in a way that makes it much easier to understand and learn for beginners. He is also fantastic one on one in office hours and will try a myriad of methods to help you with any concepts you're struggling with. On top of all that, he's just an awesome guy who makes japanese class fun with his sense of humor and mannerisms. This class is worth it for him alone.",
